## [](#links) Links
Below is a collection of helpful links for students.

* I built this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
* I use [KaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaTeX) to render mathematics on my pages. This has the advantage of being blazing fast in [comparison](https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php) to [MathJax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathJax). However, not all of the functionality of MathJax has been ported to KaTeX.
* If you do not already know how to use [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), Wikibooks has a great reference [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX).
* Most of the figures I include in my documents were built using [Asymptote](http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/). There are several great tutorials on using Asymptote online; for example,  Charles Staats' [notes](https://math.uchicago.edu/~cstaats/notesandpapers.html) and [AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) offers a very basic [reference](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Asymptote_(Vector_Graphics_Language)).
* [Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/)
* [Purdue Geometry Seminar](https://sites.google.com/site/purduegeometryseminar/)
* [Geometric Group Theory](http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~jon.mccammond/geogrouptheory/)
* For graduate students interested in topology, join the [topology students mailing list](https://lists.purdue.edu/mailman/listinfo/topologystudents).
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) (which recently acquired [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2017/07/20/sharelatex-joins-overleaf.html)) is a great online LaTeX editor and Purdue University students get extra features. I particularly enjoy cloning a project using [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and editing the files with my favorite text editor [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).
* Real programers use Emacs
>![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/real_programmers.png){:class="img-responsive" height="350px"} 
* Emacs creates a lot of clutter in your project folders so if you are working with git you are going to want to keep track of what gets pushed into your repository. Fortunately you can do that by including a .gitignore file in your project folder and you can use [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/) to help you get started with that.
* My first introduction into programming came from a (now) little known book called [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). This book has been very influential in the way I think about programming.
