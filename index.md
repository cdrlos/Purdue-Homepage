## [](#links) Links
Below is a collection of helpful links for students.

* I built this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
* I use [KaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaTeX) to render mathematics on my pages, but not all of the functionally of [MathJax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathJax) has been implemented. You too can enable this blazing fast rendering engine on your pages by following [this post](https://xuc.me/blog/katex-and-jekyll/).
* [Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/)
* [Purdue Geometry Seminar](https://sites.google.com/site/purduegeometryseminar/)
* [Geometric Group Theory](http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~jon.mccammond/geogrouptheory/)
* For graduate students interested in topology, join the [topology students mailing list](https://lists.purdue.edu/mailman/listinfo/topologystudents).
