## []() Recitation â€” August 27, 2018
We discussed several course policies outlined in this document: [Ground Rules](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~chenjk/MA26100GroundrulesFall2018.pdf). The most important policy, as far as we are concerned, is that **three of your lowest quizzes** will be dropped. To quote the document:
> There are 37 online assignments which you will complete using
> [WebAssign](https://www.webassign.net/purdue/login.html). Of those homework
> assignments, your **three lowest** scores will be dropped... There are 11
> quizzes to be given out during recitation. Of those quizzes, your **three
> lowest** scores will be dropped.

We also talked a little bit about how this course is graded. As outlined in the [Ground Rules](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~chenjk/MA26100GroundrulesFall2018.pdf), your grade will be computed as follows:

| :-------------: | ----------: |
| Homework        | 100 points  |
| Quizzes         | 50 points   |
| Midterm 1 and 2 | 200 points  |
| Final Exam      | 200         |
|-----------------|-------------|
|                 | 550 points  |

We will use your exam scores to determine cutoffs and the total number of
students meeting each cutoff will determine the number of **A**s, **B**s,
**C**s, etc., I will give out. For example, if the **A** cutoff is determined to
be 360/400 points in the exams and ten students achieve 360 or more points, I
will give out 10 **A**s to the students from my combined recitation sections who
scored the highest out of 550 points. **B**s, **C**s, and **D**s are assigned in
the same fashion; by determining the letter grade cutoff, and seeing how many
students meet that letter grade cutoff, but fall under the above letter grade
cutoff (for example, students who meet the **B** cutoff, but fall short of the
**A** cutoff).
