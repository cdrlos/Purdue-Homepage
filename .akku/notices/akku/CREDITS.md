Akku.scm uses the dependency solver from aptitude. The code is
originally copyrighted by Daniel Burrows and ported to Scheme by
Andreas Rottmann as part of Dorodongo.

Akku.scm also uses numerous SRFIs and other packages, all of which can
be found referenced in the Akku.lock file.

The idea of using an activation script was borrowed from Python's
virtualenv.
